## Here we Collect Some ES5=>ES6 Observations

- https://github.com/lebab/lebab/issues/313 reserved keyword do work in some cases and do not error when directly assigned on exports in esModules
- https://github.com/airbnb/ts-migrate a anti pattern do never migrate to .ts files it gives you nothing but headache! only use the Typechecker Part of Typescript it is not a good Compiler most of the time. 
- Typescript for bundlers! You should most best use typescript classic resolve without additional types fild in package.json and then reference absolute file pathes. Also always generate a project local folder of flat dependencies ```./modules/**/*{.d.ts,.js}``` js content ```export * from 'node_modules/module_name/entrypoint.js``` d.ts content ```export * from 'node_modules/module_name/types.d.ts``` that is the so called classic moduleResolve mode of typescript and works most best even for bundlers and would allow to even bundle type definitions in case that you got no time to convert them. 
- always use named exports without a default export that makes the code most transpil able also add a marker prop ```exports["__esModule"] = true;``` most best at the beginning of that file to indicate that this is a transpiled ES6 module without a default export esModule you can even add that marker property always to your d.ts files even if they get used for a ES6+ Module it does not harm as such modules will anyway never go trough helper functions of transpilers like typescript or babel or anything else. While they clear indicate to tooling that this file has no default export!
