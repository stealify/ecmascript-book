# WiP: ecmascript-book
A Current Book about ECMAScript and what works and what not works and maybe some history.

Mainly This book should give you a Understanding why i have choosen ECMAScript as Centric Glue Code and also Definition Language
- ECMAScript as a Dynamic Language by Default gets always Runned inside a Engine but is Easy Engough To get Transpiled to Low Level Code.
- ECMAScript as a Dynamic Language can by Design and Default Represent anything so it is awsome. 
- There exists a Lot of People who know and Understand the Language as also its Async Implication 
- Implements Fundamental Core concepts by design
  - using Handels (Objects) 
  - Produces Optimized Code that Even can Optimize more later at Runtime
  - is Async by Design as it needs to Interact with a Host that Implements it. Overall it is designed as Universal Handel Based Language that you can Improve your Self while not loosing the flexibility to go Nativ. As Python is dead It is also the Successor over Python.
  - isolation/security.
